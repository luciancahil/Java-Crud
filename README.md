# Java-Crud

This program is a terminal Crudd that allowed me to take notes quickly on what HTML tags and attributes do, how to utilize them, and which tags and atttribues affect each other.

It was also a great time for me to practice different methods of data storage, including my own .txt format, an XML file, and writing everything to an SQL server.
